## Project Link

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to add interactivity to the landing page of a website. In this project I added JavaScript that highlighted the section of the HTML that was active in the viewport. In addition, I used JavaScript to build the navbar based on an aribitrary number of sections. Lastly, I added Javascript that highlighted the appropriate section of the navbar based on which section of the HTML was currently being viewed (or active in the viewport).

## Usage
